Try it out
==========
(At this point, there are no binaries yet)

For now, you need to install [Node Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit), it has binaries for the 3 mayor operating systems.

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ibito/SubLAME.git
```

And finally, just run SubLAME with Node Webkit:
```
nw /path/to/SubLAME
```

Tech
====

SubLAME uses a number of open source projects to work:
- [Node Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)
- [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net)
- (we're sure we'll use more)
